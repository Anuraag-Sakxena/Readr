# Readr — Product Vision

## 1. One-Line Definition

Readr is a finite, edition-based news application designed to help users get informed and then disengage—without infinite scrolling, algorithmic addiction, or attention hijacking.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy (Non‑Negotiable)

**Get informed. Get out.**

Readr exists to respect the user’s time, attention, and mental bandwidth. It is not built to maximize engagement, session length, or emotional arousal. Completion—not consumption—is the primary success metric.

These principles are permanent and must never be violated.

---

## 3. The Problem Readr Solves

Modern news and social platforms:

* Encourage compulsive scrolling
* Use engagement-driven algorithms
* Blur the line between information and stimulation
* Punish users for trying to disengage

This leads to:

* Anxiety and cognitive fatigue
* Information overload
* Loss of intentional reading habits

Readr solves this by **reintroducing boundaries**.

---

## 4. Readr’s Core Design Rules (Hard Constraints)

The following rules are absolute:

1. **No infinite scrolling** — ever.
2. **Every session must have a clear ending.**
3. **Content is finite and edition-based.**
4. **User choice overrides algorithms.**
5. **LLMs serve comprehension, not engagement.**
6. **Optional depth must never become a rabbit hole.**

If a feature violates even one rule, it is rejected.

---

## 5. Edition-Based Consumption Model

Readr mimics the mental model of a traditional newspaper:

* A finite set of stories per edition
* A clear start and a clear end
* Optional extended coverage, still finite
* No auto-refresh, no endless discovery

Editions reset on a **12-hour cycle**, reinforcing healthy reading rhythms without punitive locks.

---

## 6. Screen Card Interaction Model

Readr is built entirely around **full-screen vertical Screen Cards**.

Each Screen Card represents exactly **one focused interaction**.

Examples:

* Welcome Card
* Home Card
* News Card
* End of Today’s Edition Card
* Extended Coverage Card
* Final Completion Card

There are:

* No tabs
* No background feeds
* No hidden content streams

---

## 7. News Card Editorial Structure

Each News Card follows a strict editorial anatomy:

* **Headline** — factual, neutral
* **What Happened** — concise summary
* **Why It Matters** — context
* **What’s Next (optional)** — forward-looking clarity

This structure prevents sensationalism and ensures clarity.

---

## 8. Role of AI in Readr

AI is a **tool**, not a driver.

LLMs are used only for:

* Summarization
* Structuring information
* Optional simplification or comparison

LLMs must never:

* Optimize engagement
* Personalize for addiction
* Auto-expand content endlessly

AI outputs must be deterministic, reviewable, and bounded.

---

## 9. Success Metrics (What We Actually Optimize)

Readr does **not** optimize for:

* Time spent
* Daily active minutes
* Infinite retention curves

Readr optimizes for:

* Session completion
* Clarity gained
* User trust
* Calm disengagement

The best Readr session ends quietly.

---

## 10. Long-Term Vision

Readr aims to become:

* A trusted daily briefing companion
* A counterexample to addictive media
* A product that users respect—and feel respected by

If Readr ever feels louder, faster, or more compulsive, the product has failed its mission.

---

## Final Principle

> If a feature does not help the user finish reading and move on with their life, it does not belong in Readr.
